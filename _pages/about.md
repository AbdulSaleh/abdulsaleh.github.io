I am a rising senior at Harvard College studying Computer Science and Statistics. I am spending this summer working with the [Affective Computing Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/affective-computing/overview/) at the MIT Media Lab where I am using reinforcement learning to train socially aware dialogue systems. I am working under the supervision of Natasha Jaques and Rosalind Picard. 

I have previously worked with the [Spoken Language Systems Group](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/spoken-language-systems-group) at MIT's CSAIL under the supervision of Ramy Baly and James Glass. During my time at SLS, I researched novel transfer learning methods for NLP and built neural models for detecting hyperpartisan news.
