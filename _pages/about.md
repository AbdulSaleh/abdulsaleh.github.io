I am a senior studying Computer Science and Statistics at Harvard College. I am interested in building algorithms that can reason about language and communicate the same way we do. My research interests are **natural language processing** (NLP) and **dialog generation**.

I wrote my [senior thesis](https://abdulsaleh.github.io/files/AbdulSaleh_Social_and_Interpretable_Dialog_Systems.pdf) on social and interpretable dialog systems. I was advised by [Yonatan Belinkov](http://people.csail.mit.edu/belinkov/) and [Stuart Shieber](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/).

I will be joining **Google MTV** as a software engineer in July!

I previously interned with the [Affective Computing Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/affective-computing/overview/) at the MIT Media Lab under the supervision of [Natasha Jaques](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/jaquesn/overview/) and [Rosalind Picard](http://web.media.mit.edu/~picard/). I also previously worked with the [Spoken Language Systems Group](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/spoken-language-systems-group) at MIT's CSAIL under the supervision of [Ramy Baly](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/ramy-baly) and [James Glass](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/jim-glass).


<!-- I am a senior studying Computer Science and Statistics at Harvard College. I am interested in neural methods for natural language processing and generation. I am a firm believer that progress in AI is driven by building generalizable, human-centered systems rather than optimizing for simple performance metrics on narrow benchmark tasks. As such, I am currently working on building social and interpretable dialog systems for my senior thesis. I am advised by [Yonatan Belinkov](http://people.csail.mit.edu/belinkov/) and [Stuart Shieber](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/).-->

During my time at SLS, I researched novel transfer learning methods for NLP and trained models for detecting hyperpartisan news to help fight misinformation online. -->
