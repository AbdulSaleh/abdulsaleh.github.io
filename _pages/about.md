I am a senior studying Computer Science and Statistics at Harvard College. My research interests are at the intersection of natural language processing and human-computer interaction. I am spending this summer working with the [Affective Computing Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/affective-computing/overview/) at the MIT Media Lab where I am using reinforcement learning to train socially aware dialogue systems. I am working under the supervision of [Natasha Jaques](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/jaquesn/overview/) and [Rosalind Picard](http://web.media.mit.edu/~picard/). 

I have previously worked with the [Spoken Language Systems Group](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/spoken-language-systems-group) at MIT's CSAIL under the supervision of [Ramy Baly](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/ramy-baly) and [James Glass](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/jim-glass). During my time at SLS, I researched novel transfer learning methods for NLP and built neural models for detecting hyperpartisan news.
