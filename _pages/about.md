I am a senior studying Computer Science and Statistics at Harvard College. I am interested in neural methods for natural language processing and generation. I am a firm believer that progress in AI is driven by building generalizable, human-centered systems rather than optimizing for simple performance metrics on narrow benchmark tasks. As such, I am currently working on building social and interpretable dialog systems for my senior thesis. I am advised by [Yonatan Belinkov](http://people.csail.mit.edu/belinkov/) and [Stuart Shieber](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/).

I spent this summer working on reinforcement learning for dialog with the [Affective Computing Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/affective-computing/overview/) at the MIT Media Lab. I was working under the supervision of [Natasha Jaques](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/jaquesn/overview/) and [Rosalind Picard](http://web.media.mit.edu/~picard/).

I have also previously worked with the [Spoken Language Systems Group](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/spoken-language-systems-group) at MIT's CSAIL under the supervision of [Ramy Baly](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/ramy-baly) and [James Glass](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/jim-glass). During my time at SLS, I researched novel transfer learning methods for NLP and trained models for detecting hyperpartisan news to help fight misinformation online.
